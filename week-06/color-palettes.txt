# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: Monochromatic Palette.png
Explanation of your color choices:
I chose the dark red colors because Iâ€™ve noticed that advertising for high-end, custom-made gaming laptops are presented dark colored with black.  Usually the design color of these laptops are also dark as well.  Dark red stood out to me for gaming laptops.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename: Shaded Color Palette.png
Explanation of your color choices:
For my shaded color palette I chose green with yellow because green portrays the plants that produce organic foods and green/yellow shows the colors of nature.  Also, I chose this green/yellow palette because it is a lighter color and it makes it more inviting, much like natural and organic foods are welcoming and promote a happier healthier lifestyle.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: A Complementary Palette
Explanation of your color choices:
For my complementary palette I chose dark colors that had more business appeal since this would be for a banking website.  When it comes to banking I usually think of blue as a lot of ATMs have blue lighting and blue is becoming a popular color choice for banking.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename: Triadic Palette
Explanation of your color choices:
For my Triadic Palette I tried to choose the most colorful colors I could, nothing too bright and nothing too dark.  Since it would be a website that offers games for children I figured these colors in my triadic palette would appeal to them the most and I tried to not make them too distracting.
